Hello there! I'm Hyunwoo Oh.

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, supervised by [Prof. Mohsen Imani](http://www.mohsenimani.com/){:target="_blank"} @ [BIASLab](https://biaslab.ics.uci.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

My research sits at the intersection of computer architecture, machine learning, and hardware–software co-design. I build efficient systems that scale emerging AI models—such as large language models, multimodal models, vision transformers, and GNNs—under tight performance, energy, and cost constraints.

I specialize in architecture-level co-design of algorithms and hardware: CPU ISA extensions and SIMD kernels for low-precision inference, FPGA and ASIC accelerators for multimodal AI, and system-level designs for real-time embedded sensing. I enjoy working across the stack, from quantization and model optimization down to RTL, FPGA prototyping, and chip tape-outs.

Previously, I was a Junior Engineer at Hanwha Systems, a leading Korean defense electronics company, where I designed SoC FPGA–based image processing pipelines, developed RTOS software, and optimized compute kernels for heterogeneous SoCs for infrared imaging systems.

Before starting my PhD, I received my M.S. in Electronic Engineering from Seoul National University of Science and Technology, advised by Prof. Seung Eun Lee. My master’s work explored processor architectures for posit arithmetic and domain-specific parallel accelerators, mostly realized on FPGAs and later fabricated as ASICs.
