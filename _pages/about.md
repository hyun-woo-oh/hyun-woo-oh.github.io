Hello there! I'm Hyunwoo Oh.

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, supervised by [Prof. Mohsen Imani](http://www.mohsenimani.com/){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on scaling emerging AI models (e.g., multimodal, ViT, GNN) that demand massive computational resources into more affordable and efficient solutions. I specialize in architecture-level hardware-software co-design and implementation, often exploring more high- and low-level topics such as AI model optimizations and novel circuit/system designs like processing-in-memory (PIM). I love venturing beyond my core research areas and embracing challenges.

Previously, I was a Junior Engineer at Hanwha Systems, a leading Korean defense electronics company, where I worked on designing SoC FPGA-based image processors, developing RTOS, and optimizing compute kernels for heterogeneous SoCs—primarily for infrared image processing.

I earned my M.S. in Electronic Engineering from Seoul National University of Science and Technology in 2023, advised by [Prof. Seung Eun Lee](https://soc.seoultech.ac.kr/Professor/Professor.html){:target="_blank"}. My Master’s research included:

1. Designing flexible architectures to incorporate novel standard for real number arithmetic, specifically "posit", into general-purpose processors.
2. Integrating domain-specific hardware for parallel processing into conventional general-purpose processors.

Most of my work was implemented using FPGAs, and some projects were fabricated into ASICs.
