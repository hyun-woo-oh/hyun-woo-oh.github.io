    abstract = {This paper presents a real-time embedded thermal imaging system architecture for compact, energy-efficient, high-quality imaging utilizing heterogeneous system-on-chip and uncooled infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPAs). In contrast to previous systems that organized separate devices for complex image processing, our system provides integrated image processing support for robust sensor-to-surveillance. We organized the image processing architecture into two algorithm stacks: a non-uniformity correction stack to mitigate the distinctive noise vulnerability of uncooled IRFPAs and an image enhancement stack, which includes contrast enhancement and frame-level temporal noise filters. We optimized the algorithms for domain-specific factors, including asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP), cache organization, single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions, and very long instruction word (VLIW) architectures. The implementation on TI TDA3x SoC demonstrates that our system can process 640×480, 60 frames per second (FPS) videos at a peak core load of 57.5% while consuming power less than 2.2 W for the entire system, denoting the possibility of processing the 1280×1024, 30 FPS videos from the state-of-the-art IRFPAs.},

Weighted median filter (WMF)-based processors are commonly employed for their excellent refinement performance. However, when implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), WMF-based processors face a trade-off between hardware resource utilization and refinement performance. To address this trade-off, we previously proposed a new disparity refinement processor based on the hybrid max-median filter (HMMF). However, our earlier work did not guarantee flawless operation in large occluded and texture-less regions, particularly in areas with numerous holes. In order to overcome this limitation of conventional processors, we proposed a cell-based disparity refinement processor. This processor extends our previous HMMF-based disparity refinement processor. To evaluate its refinement performance, we conducted experiments using four types of publicly available stereo datasets. When comparing refinement performance, our proposed processor outperforms conventional processors when using the KITTI 2012 and 2015 stereo benchmark datasets. Additionally, the results demonstrate that our proposed processor exhibits superior refinement performance when applied to the Cityscapes and StereoDriving datasets in comparison to conventional processors. Furthermore, when considering hardware resource utilization, our proposed processor demonstrates lower resource requirements than conventional processors when implemented on an FPGA. Therefore, our proposed disparity refinement processor is well-suited for the disparity refinement process in stereo vision systems that require cost-effectiveness and high performance.},

Our processor provides a one-chip solution for incorporating non-uniformity correction (NUC) algorithms and contrast enhancement methods (CEM) to be performed seamlessly. We have employed NUC algorithms that utilize multiple coefficients to ensure robust image quality, free from ghosting effects and blurring. These algorithms include polynomial modeling-based thermal drift compensation (TDC), two-point correction (TPC), and run-time discrete flat field correction (FFC). To address the memory bottlenecks originating from the parallel execution of NUC algorithms in real-time, we designed accelerators and parallel caching modules for pixel-wise algorithms based on a multi-parameter polynomial expression. Furthermore, we designed a specialized accelerator architecture to minimize the interrupted time for run-time FFC. The implementation on the XC7Z020CLG400 SoC FPGA with the QuantumRed VR thermal module demonstrates that our image processing module achieves a throughput of 60 frames per second (FPS) when processing 14-bit 640×480 resolution infrared video acquired from an uncooled IRFPA.},

    abstract = {Edge computing is becoming increasingly popular in artificial intelligence (AI) application development due to the benefits of local execution. One widely used approach to overcome hardware limitations in edge computing is heterogeneous computing, which combines a general-purpose processor with a domain-specific AI processor. However, this approach can be inefficient due to the communication overhead resulting from the complex communication protocol. To avoid communication overhead, the concept of an application-specific instruction set processor based on customizable instruction set architecture (ISA) has emerged. By integrating the AI processor into the processor core, on-chip communication replaces the complex communication protocol. Further, custom instruction set extension (ISE) reduces the number of instructions needed to execute AI applications. In this paper, we propose a uniprocessor system architecture for lightweight AI systems. First, we define the custom ISE to integrate the AI processor and GPP into a single processor, minimizing communication overhead. Next, we designed the processor based on the integrated core architecture, including the base core and the AI core, and implemented the processor on an FPGA. Finally, we evaluated the proposed architecture through simulation and implementation of the processor. The results show that the designed processor consumed 6.62\% more lookup tables and 74\% fewer flip-flops while achieving up to 193.88 times enhanced throughput performance and 52.75 times the energy efficiency compared to the previous system.},

    abstract = {Recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technology encourage the adoption of AI systems for various applications. In most deployments, AI-based computing systems adopt the architecture in which the central server processes most of the data. This characteristic makes the system use a high amount of network bandwidth and can cause security issues. In order to overcome these issues, a new AI model called federated learning was presented. Federated learning adopts an architecture in which the clients take care of data training and transmit only the trained result to the central server. As the data training from the client abstracts and reduces the original data, the system operates with reduced network resources and reinforced data security. A system with federated learning supports a variety of client systems. To build an AI system with resource-limited client systems, composing the client system with multiple embedded AI processors is valid. For realizing the system with this architecture, introducing a controller to arbitrate and utilize the AI processors becomes a stringent requirement. In this paper, we propose an embedded AI system for federated learning that can be composed ﬂexibly with the AI core depending on the application. In order to realize the proposed system, we designed a controller for multiple AI cores and implemented it on a ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA). The operation of the designed controller was veriﬁed through image and speech applications, and the performance was veriﬁed through a simulator.},

    abstract = {Recently, advances in technology have enabled embedded systems to be adopted for a variety of applications. Some of these applications require real-time 2D graphics processing running on limited design speciﬁcations such as low power consumption and a small area. In order to satisfy such conditions, including a speciﬁc 2D graphics accelerator in the embedded system is an effective method. This method reduces the workload of the processor in the embedded system by exploiting the accelerator. The accelerator assists the system to perform 2D graphics processing in real-time. Therefore, a variety of applications that require 2D graphics processing can be implemented with an embedded processor. In this paper, we present a 2D graphics accelerator for tiny embedded systems. The accelerator includes an optimized line-drawing operation based on Bresenham’s algorithm. The optimized operation enables the accelerator to deal with various kinds of 2D graphics processing and to perform the line-drawing instead of the system processor. Moreover, the accelerator also distributes the workload of the processor core by removing the need for the core to access the frame buffer memory. We measure the performance of the accelerator by implementing the processor, including the accelerator, on a ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA), and ascertaining the possibility of realization by synthesizing using the 180 nm CMOS process.},

    abstract = {The development of the mobile industry brings about the demand for high-performance embedded systems in order to meet the requirement of user-centered application. Because of the limitation of memory resource, employing compressed data is efﬁcient for an embedded system. However, the workload for data decompression causes an extreme bottleneck to the embedded processor. One of the ways to alleviate the bottleneck is to integrate a hardware accelerator along with the processor, constructing a system-on-chip (SoC) for the embedded system. In this paper, we propose a lossless decompression accelerator for an embedded processor, which supports LZ77 decompression and static Huffman decoding for an inﬂate algorithm. The accelerator is implemented on a ﬁeld programmable gate array (FPGA) to verify the functional suitability and fabricated in a Samsung 65 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. The performance of the accelerator is evaluated by the Canterbury corpus benchmark and achieved throughput up to 20.7 MB/s at 50 MHz system clock frequency.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we propose a 32-bit processor for the embedded system. In order to provide less area and low power operation, we adopt MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA) to our processor. The processor consists of five pipeline stages to reduce the critical path. In order to solve the data hazard in pipeline stages, we design the data forwarding unit and stall unit with optimized bubble insertion. The processor is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), and we verify the functionality of the processor and measure the performance by using the Dhrystone benchmark. The Dhrystone MIPS (DMIPS) is measured at 27.71 at 50 MHz operation.},
