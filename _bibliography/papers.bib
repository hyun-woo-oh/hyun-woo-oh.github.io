    abstract = {Task-oriented object detection is increasingly essential for intelligent sensing applications, enabling AI systems to operate autonomously in complex, real-world environments such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. Conventional models often struggle with generalization, requiring vast datasets to accurately detect objects within diverse contexts. In this work, we introduce iTask, a taskoriented object detection framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generalize efficiently from limited samples by generating an abstract knowledge graph. This graph encapsulates essential task attributes, allowing iTask to identify objects based on high-level characteristics rather than extensive data, making it possible to adapt to complex mission requirements with minimal samples. iTask addresses the challenges of high computational cost and resource limitations in vision-language models by offering two configuration models: a distilled, task-specific vision transformer optimized for high accuracy in defined tasks, and a quantized version of the model for broader applicability across multiple tasks. Additionally, we designed a hardware acceleration circuit to support real-time processing, essential for edge devices that require low latency and efficient task execution. Our evaluations show that the task-specific configuration achieves a 15% higher accuracy over the quantized configuration in specific scenarios, while the quantized model provides robust multi-task performance. The hardware-accelerated iTask system achieves a 3.5x speedup and a 40% reduction in energy consumption compared to GPU-based implementations. These results demonstrate that iTask ’s dual-configuration approach and situational adaptability offer a scalable solution for task-specific object detection, providing robust and efficient performance in resource-constrained environments.}

    abstract = {Machine learning-based object detection systems are preferred due to their cost-effectiveness compared to deep learning approaches. Among machine learning methods, the Viola-Jones classifier stands out for its reasonable accuracy and efficient resource utilization. However, as the number of classification iterations increases or the resolution of the input image increases, the detection processing speed may decrease. To address the detection speed issue related to input image resolution, an improved edge component calibration method is applied. Additionally, an edge-based operation skip scheme is proposed to overcome the detection processing speed problem caused by the number of classification iterations. Our experiments using the FDDB public dataset show that our method reduces classification iterations by 24.6157% to 84.1288% compared to conventional methods, except for our previous study. Importantly, our method maintains detection accuracy while reducing classification iterations. This result implies that our method can realize almost real-time object detection when implemented on field-programmable gate arrays.},

In this paper, we propose a method to smoothly transition between a method of correcting non-uniformity using a shutter one time when the thermal imaging camera is not stable at the start-up, and a method of correcting non-uniformity by performing conventional NUC (Non-Uniformity Correction) when thermal image camera is stabilized. The proposed method was confirmed to have similar performance to the conventional method in which the thermal imaging camera uses the shutter several times during initial start-up. The conventional method closes the shutter multiple times to correct non-uniformity, which obscures information necessary for driving. In contrast, the proposed method closes the shutter only one time during initial start-up to correct non-uniformity, which does not obscure information necessary for driving. Therefore, it is suitable for auxiliary systems used in autonomous driving platforms.},

    abstract = {In the autonomous driving industry, there is a growing trend to employ long-wave infrared (LWIR)-based uncooled thermal-imaging cameras, capable of robustly collecting data even in extreme environments. Consequently, both industry and academia are actively researching contrast-enhancement techniques to improve the quality of LWIR-based thermal-imaging cameras. However, most research results only showcase experimental outcomes using mass-produced products that already incorporate contrast-enhancement techniques. Put differently, there is a lack of experimental data on contrast enhancement post-non-uniformity (NUC) and temperature compensation (TC) processes, which generate the images seen in the final products. To bridge this gap, we propose a histogram equalization (HE)-based contrast enhancement method that incorporates a region-based clipping technique. Furthermore, we present experimental results on the images obtained after applying NUC and TC processes. We simultaneously conducted visual and qualitative performance evaluations on images acquired after NUC and TC processes. In the visual evaluation, it was confirmed that the proposed method improves image clarity and contrast ratio compared to conventional HE-based methods, even in challenging driving scenarios such as tunnels. In the qualitative evaluation, the proposed method demonstrated upper-middle-class rankings in both image quality and processing speed metrics. Therefore, our proposed method proves to be effective for the essential contrast enhancement process in LWIR-based uncooled thermal-imaging cameras intended for autonomous driving platforms.},

We organized the image processing architecture into two algorithm stacks: a non-uniformity correction stack to mitigate the distinctive noise vulnerability of uncooled IRFPAs and an image enhancement stack, which includes contrast enhancement and frame-level temporal noise filters. We optimized the algorithms for domain-specific factors, including asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP), cache organization, single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions, and very long instruction word (VLIW) architectures. The implementation on TI TDA3x SoC demonstrates that our system can process 640×480, 60 frames per second (FPS) videos at a peak core load of 57.5% while consuming power less than 2.2 W for the entire system, denoting the possibility of processing the 1280×1024, 30 FPS videos from the state-of-the-art IRFPAs.},

Weighted median filter (WMF)-based processors are commonly employed for their excellent refinement performance. However, when implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), WMF-based processors face a trade-off between hardware resource utilization and refinement performance. To address this trade-off, we previously proposed a new disparity refinement processor based on the hybrid max-median filter (HMMF). However, our earlier work did not guarantee flawless operation in large occluded and texture-less regions, particularly in areas with numerous holes. In order to overcome this limitation of conventional processors, we proposed a cell-based disparity refinement processor. This processor extends our previous HMMF-based disparity refinement processor. To evaluate its refinement performance, we conducted experiments using four types of publicly available stereo datasets. When comparing refinement performance, our proposed processor outperforms conventional processors when using the KITTI 2012 and 2015 stereo benchmark datasets. Additionally, the results demonstrate that our proposed processor exhibits superior refinement performance when applied to the Cityscapes and StereoDriving datasets in comparison to conventional processors. Furthermore, when considering hardware resource utilization, our proposed processor demonstrates lower resource requirements than conventional processors when implemented on an FPGA. Therefore, our proposed disparity refinement processor is well-suited for the disparity refinement process in stereo vision systems that require cost-effectiveness and high performance.},

Our processor provides a one-chip solution for incorporating non-uniformity correction (NUC) algorithms and contrast enhancement methods (CEM) to be performed seamlessly. We have employed NUC algorithms that utilize multiple coefficients to ensure robust image quality, free from ghosting effects and blurring. These algorithms include polynomial modeling-based thermal drift compensation (TDC), two-point correction (TPC), and run-time discrete flat field correction (FFC). To address the memory bottlenecks originating from the parallel execution of NUC algorithms in real-time, we designed accelerators and parallel caching modules for pixel-wise algorithms based on a multi-parameter polynomial expression. Furthermore, we designed a specialized accelerator architecture to minimize the interrupted time for run-time FFC. The implementation on the XC7Z020CLG400 SoC FPGA with the QuantumRed VR thermal module demonstrates that our image processing module achieves a throughput of 60 frames per second (FPS) when processing 14-bit 640×480 resolution infrared video acquired from an uncooled IRFPA.},

    abstract = {Edge computing is becoming increasingly popular in artificial intelligence (AI) application development due to the benefits of local execution. One widely used approach to overcome hardware limitations in edge computing is heterogeneous computing, which combines a general-purpose processor with a domain-specific AI processor. However, this approach can be inefficient due to the communication overhead resulting from the complex communication protocol. To avoid communication overhead, the concept of an application-specific instruction set processor based on customizable instruction set architecture (ISA) has emerged. By integrating the AI processor into the processor core, on-chip communication replaces the complex communication protocol. Further, custom instruction set extension (ISE) reduces the number of instructions needed to execute AI applications. In this paper, we propose a uniprocessor system architecture for lightweight AI systems. First, we define the custom ISE to integrate the AI processor and GPP into a single processor, minimizing communication overhead. Next, we designed the processor based on the integrated core architecture, including the base core and the AI core, and implemented the processor on an FPGA. Finally, we evaluated the proposed architecture through simulation and implementation of the processor. The results show that the designed processor consumed 6.62\% more lookup tables and 74\% fewer flip-flops while achieving up to 193.88 times enhanced throughput performance and 52.75 times the energy efficiency compared to the previous system.},

    abstract = {An intelligent transportation system (ITS) is a future system that combines various technologies to provide safety and convenience to humans. In order to implement ITS, previous systems applied an architecture that contains a large number of data centers with a high-performance general-purpose processor and graphics processing unit to collect the information of vehicles. However, this architecture not only requires a high network bandwidth but also causes the system to decrease power efficiency and makes security weak. In this paper, we propose an ITS based on an edge AI device which solves problems with the existing structure. We applied the edge AI device which is applicable to various systems in ITS to license plate recognition and the highest accuracy was 0.94. We implemented the edge AI device on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and verified the feasibility of the entire system with the proposed edge AI device.},

This paper proposes a local interconnect network (LIN) controller for resource-constrained devices. The designed LIN controller efficiently reduces the workload of target devices by processing the LIN frame header, data response, and protocol errors. To demonstrate the feasibility of design, a Cortex-M0 is employed as a main processor and connected to the LIN controller. We implemented a LIN node by programming the processor, and the functionality of LIN controller was verified with a LIN frame analyzer and hardware scope. In addition, we analyzed the affection of communication loads on the processor and evaluated the benefits of LIN controller.},

    abstract = {Recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technology encourage the adoption of AI systems for various applications. In most deployments, AI-based computing systems adopt the architecture in which the central server processes most of the data. This characteristic makes the system use a high amount of network bandwidth and can cause security issues. In order to overcome these issues, a new AI model called federated learning was presented. Federated learning adopts an architecture in which the clients take care of data training and transmit only the trained result to the central server. As the data training from the client abstracts and reduces the original data, the system operates with reduced network resources and reinforced data security. A system with federated learning supports a variety of client systems. To build an AI system with resource-limited client systems, composing the client system with multiple embedded AI processors is valid. For realizing the system with this architecture, introducing a controller to arbitrate and utilize the AI processors becomes a stringent requirement. In this paper, we propose an embedded AI system for federated learning that can be composed ﬂexibly with the AI core depending on the application. In order to realize the proposed system, we designed a controller for multiple AI cores and implemented it on a ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA). The operation of the designed controller was veriﬁed through image and speech applications, and the performance was veriﬁed through a simulator.},

    abstract = {Recently, advances in technology have enabled embedded systems to be adopted for a variety of applications. Some of these applications require real-time 2D graphics processing running on limited design speciﬁcations such as low power consumption and a small area. In order to satisfy such conditions, including a speciﬁc 2D graphics accelerator in the embedded system is an effective method. This method reduces the workload of the processor in the embedded system by exploiting the accelerator. The accelerator assists the system to perform 2D graphics processing in real-time. Therefore, a variety of applications that require 2D graphics processing can be implemented with an embedded processor. In this paper, we present a 2D graphics accelerator for tiny embedded systems. The accelerator includes an optimized line-drawing operation based on Bresenham’s algorithm. The optimized operation enables the accelerator to deal with various kinds of 2D graphics processing and to perform the line-drawing instead of the system processor. Moreover, the accelerator also distributes the workload of the processor core by removing the need for the core to access the frame buffer memory. We measure the performance of the accelerator by implementing the processor, including the accelerator, on a ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA), and ascertaining the possibility of realization by synthesizing using the 180 nm CMOS process.},

Because of the limitation of memory resource, employing compressed data is efﬁcient for an embedded system. However, the workload for data decompression causes an extreme bottleneck to the embedded processor. One of the ways to alleviate the bottleneck is to integrate a hardware accelerator along with the processor, constructing a system-on-chip (SoC) for the embedded system. In this paper, we propose a lossless decompression accelerator for an embedded processor, which supports LZ77 decompression and static Huffman decoding for an inﬂate algorithm. The accelerator is implemented on a ﬁeld programmable gate array (FPGA) to verify the functional suitability and fabricated in a Samsung 65 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. The performance of the accelerator is evaluated by the Canterbury corpus benchmark and achieved throughput up to 20.7 MB/s at 50 MHz system clock frequency.},
